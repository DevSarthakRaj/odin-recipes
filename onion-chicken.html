    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>French Onion-Breaded Baked Chicken is one of the best chicken dishes you will ever taste.</p>
    <p>The ingredients and recipes for this dish can be found below.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 cups bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1 (1 ounce) package dry French onion soup mix</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoons mayonnaise
        </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garlic paste
        </li>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Mix bread crumbs and dry soup mix together in a bowl.

        </li>
        <li>Mix mayonnaise and garlic paste together in a separate bowl. Microwave on high to thin out consistency, 20 to 30 seconds.

        </li>
        <li>Brush chicken breasts with the mayonnaise mixture. Cover with the crumb mixture. Place on a baking sheet.

        </li>
        <li>Bake on the middle rack of the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
